His family were poor, rural farmers.  Despite this upbringing, he graduated close to the top of his class at the US Naval academy due to his sharp mind, unrelenting diligence, and intense ambition. \n </p>\n\n<p>After returning from his service in the Navy's Nuclear Submarine Program and beginning a family farming venture, he was elected to the state Senate in 1962.  He became known as a fierce advocate for religious freedom and a strong education system and an opponent of literacy tests and radical segregationists.  After a failed governor bid in 1966, Jimmy Carter is returning with a newfound sense of faith and ambition.  Now in 1970, he intends to utilize a populist image to emphasize his connection with the common people.  However, he may have to compromise on his personal civil rights position in order to win.",
